# Astro OpenAPI Specification

Generated from https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.2.0.md
Official Link: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.2.0.html


## Why this exists?

When building OpenAPI tools or just working with OpenAPI you need read the spec for comprehensive knowledge.
The official OpenAPI spec is rendered using [ReSpec](https://respec.org) which i found to be not the most readable one and eye pleasing.
So this is just markdown file rendered with Astro Starlight with additional fuzzy searching functionality.
